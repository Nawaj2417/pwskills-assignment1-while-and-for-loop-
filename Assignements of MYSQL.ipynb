    "Ans:- A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for efficent retrieval, management, and manipulation\n",
    "    of the data.\n",
    "    It is mainly two types:-\n",
    "        1. SQL and \n",
    "        2. NOSQL\n",
    "        \n",
    "    The difference between SQL and NOSQL are:- \n",
    "        SQL databases are  also known as relational databases which stores data in tables with\n",
    "        predefined columns and rows, and enforce strict data consistency rules.\n",
    "        It uses structured query language(SQL) to managed data.examples are:- Mysql,\n",
    "            oracle and microsoft SQL server.\n",
